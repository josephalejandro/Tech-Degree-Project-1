        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm a 21 year old puertorican guy that just moved to the United States. This was my first time traveling out of Puerto Rico and
        what made me leave my little island was the destruction that huracane Maria caused. I'm looking for a fresh start and I'm taking my chances
      trying to learn everyting I can to become a web developer. </p>

        <p>I’ve always been interested in technology and programming and I think starting as a web developer will be a great oportunity to get my feet
        in the new world that technology is creating.</p>

      <div class="card">
